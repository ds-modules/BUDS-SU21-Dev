    "Nothing frustrates both soccer fans and players as much as being [red-carded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card#Red_card). In soccer, receiving a red card from the referee means that the player awarded the red card is expelled from the game, and consequently his team must play with one fewer player for the remainder of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inherently subjective nature of referees' judgments, questions involving the fairness of red card decisions crop up frequently, especially when soccer players with darker complexions are red-carded.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this project, we will explore a dataset on red-cards and skin color and attempt to understand how different approachs to analysis can lead to different conclusions to the general question: \"Are referees more likely to give red cards to darker-skinned players?\"\n"

    "Important to note about this dataset is that it was generated as the result of an [observational study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study), rather than a [randomized controlled experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial). In an observational study, entities' independent variables (such as race, height, zip code) are observed, rather than controlled as in the randomized controlled experiment. Though data scientists often prefer the control and accuracy of controlled experiments, often performing one is either too costly or poses ethical questions (e.g., testing trial drugs and placebo treatments on cancer patients at random). Though our dataset was generated organically--in the real world rather than in a laboratory--it is statistically more challenging to prove causation among variables for these kinds of observational studies.\n",

We created a dataset of player dyads including the number of matches players and referees encountered each other and our dependent variable, the number of red cards given to a player by a particular referee throughout all matches the two encountered each other.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">*...implicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a race implicit association test (IAT), with higher values corresponding to faster white | good, black | bad associations. Explicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a racial thermometer task, with higher values corresponding to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks.*"

On our dataset we have two variables that contain that information- `rater1` and `rater2`. Since deciding what category (from very light skin- very dark skin) each player fits according to rating is a very subjective measure, we will look into each of these variables individually and then we will take the average of the two variables and use that as a new metric."
