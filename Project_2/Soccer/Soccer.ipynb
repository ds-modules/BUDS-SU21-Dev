In an observational study, entities' independent variables (such as race, height, zip code) are observed, rather than controlled as in the randomized controlled experiment. Though data scientists often prefer the control and accuracy of controlled experiments, often performing one is either too costly or poses ethical questions (e.g., testing trial drugs and placebo treatments on cancer patients at random).
