# L&S 88: Reproducibility and Open Science

**Project 1: Soccer Red Cards**

**Instructor: Eric Van Dusen, Josh Quan**

This project provides an analysis of racism in soccer, looking at data to determine if a player's skin color impacts the likelihood of receiving a red card. In the first half of the project, students perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the data first by processing the data and then visualizing the data. In the second half of the project, students create their own models that analyze the data, and they draw conclusions.
