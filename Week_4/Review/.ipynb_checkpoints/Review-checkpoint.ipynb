    "She can't cut across blocks diagonally, since there are buildings in the way.  She has to walk along the sidewalks.  Using the map below, she sees she'd have to walk 3 avenues (long blocks) and 8 streets (short blocks).  In terms of the given numbers, she computed 3 as the difference between 7 and 10, *in absolute value*, and 8 similarly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Chunhua also knows that blocks in Manhattan are all about 80m by 274m (avenues are farther apart than streets).  So in total, she'd have to walk $(80 \\times |42 - 34| + 274 \\times |7 - 10|)$ meters to get to the park.\n",
