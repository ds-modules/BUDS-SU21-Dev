    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this problem set we took a look at how we can identify points of interest in data by mapping them, and that helps us tell a story about the data that we'll be studying throughout this course. A familiarity with how we can use technical skills such as mapping, graphing and data analysis will allow us to take a more comprehensive look at the connections in our data and tie our non-technical curriculum to the ever growing need for technical analysis. \n",
