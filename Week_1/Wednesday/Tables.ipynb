    "3. The `descending=True` bit is called an *optional argument*. It has a default value of `False`, so when you explicitly tell the function `descending=True`, then the function will sort in descending order.\n",
    "4. The `distinct=True` bit is also an *optional argument*. When the function `distinct=True` is used, the function will delete any duplicate values based on the column_or_label value that was also passed in the `sort` function.\n",
    "4. Rows always stick together when a table is sorted.  It wouldn't make sense to sort just one column and leave the other columns alone.  For example, in this case, if we sorted just the `Year` column, the movies would all end up with the wrong year.\n",
